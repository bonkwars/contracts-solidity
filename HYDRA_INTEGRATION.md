# Hydra Curve Integration Analysis

## Current Implementation
The MemePool.sol contract currently uses a basic constant product AMM formula (x * y = k) with a 0.3% fee. This can be seen in the `getAmountOut` function:

```solidity
function getAmountOut(uint256 amountIn, uint256 reserveIn, uint256 reserveOut) public pure returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    // Basic constant product formula with 0.3% fee
    uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn * 997;
    uint256 numerator = amountInWithFee * reserveOut;
    uint256 denominator = (reserveIn * 1000) + amountInWithFee;
    amountOut = numerator / denominator;
}
```

## Available Hydra Curve Implementation
The HydraOpenzeppelin.sol contract contains a sophisticated liquidity curve implementation that combines:
1. Sigmoid function
2. Gaussian function
3. Rational function

These components are weighted and combined to create a dynamic liquidity curve that can better handle market conditions.

## Required Changes
To integrate the Hydra curve:

1. Add HydraOpenzeppelin contract as a dependency in MemePool
2. Initialize HydraConfig with appropriate parameters (stable, standard, or volatile)
3. Replace getAmountOut calculation with Hydra curve calculation
4. Update the swapping functions to use the new curve
5. Add price tracking for Hydra calculations

## Benefits
- More efficient liquidity utilization
- Better price stability
- Reduced impermanent loss
- Configurable market behavior (stable/standard/volatile)
