LOW SEVERITY:
- Missing events for key state changes
- Incomplete trading history cleanup
- Gas optimization opportunities in loops

### 3. MemeCoinFactory and Asset Registry
HIGH SEVERITY:
- Potential front-running in CREATE2 deployment
- Missing validation for critical metadata fields
- Possible DoS vector in asset registration

MEDIUM SEVERITY:
- Metadata URI validation could be stricter
- Asset registry updates need more access controls
- Salt generation should be more random

LOW SEVERITY:
- Gas optimization opportunities in string handling
- Missing events for metadata updates
- Incomplete cleanup of deprecated assets

## Technical Recommendations

### 1. HydraOpenzeppelin Improvements
CRITICAL:
- Add explicit bounds checking for exponentiation
- Enhance configuration validation logic
- Document all mathematical edge cases
- Add comprehensive failure recovery mechanisms

CODE EXAMPLE:
```solidity
function validateConfig(HydraConfig memory config) internal pure returns (bool) {
    if (config.sigmoidSteepness < MIN_STEEPNESS || config.sigmoidSteepness > MAX_STEEPNESS) return false;
    if (config.gaussianWidth < MIN_WIDTH || config.gaussianWidth > MAX_WIDTH) return false;
    if (config.rationalPower == 0 || config.rationalPower > MAX_POWER) return false;
    uint256 totalWeight = uint256(config.sigmoidWeight) + uint256(config.gaussianWeight) + uint256(config.rationalWeight);
    if (totalWeight != PRECISION) return false;
    return true;
}
```

### 2. SecurityManager Enhancements
CRITICAL:
- Enforce strict proof verification by default
- Implement comprehensive rate limiting
- Add multi-signature requirements for critical functions
- Enhance trading history tracking
- Implement circuit breaker patterns

CODE EXAMPLE:
```solidity
modifier withProofVerification(bytes memory proof) {
    require(falconRegistry.verifyProof(keccak256(proof)), "Invalid proof");
    require(!usedProofs[keccak256(proof)], "Proof already used");
    usedProofs[keccak256(proof)] = true;
    _;
}
```

### 3. MemeCoinFactory Security
CRITICAL:
- Add comprehensive metadata validation
- Implement front-running protection
- Enhance CREATE2 salt generation
- Add token migration capabilities
- Implement emergency pause functionality

CODE EXAMPLE:
```solidity
function validateMetadata(
    string memory imageUri,
    string memory description
) internal pure returns (bool) {
    bytes memory imageBytes = bytes(imageUri);
    bytes memory descBytes = bytes(description);
    return (imageBytes.length > 0 && imageBytes.length <= MAX_URI_LENGTH &&
            descBytes.length > 0 && descBytes.length <= MAX_DESC_LENGTH);
}
```

### 4. System-Wide Improvements
